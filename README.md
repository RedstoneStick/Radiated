Radiated
(a crappy rewrite of the HBM's Nuclear Tech Mod)
=======
You can find the original mod here: https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT

About
=======
This is a scuffed up rewrite of the original mod. It's missing a lot of features, some will be added later some won't.
Most of the textures and models will be updated to fit the new minecraft textures and since i have no idea what i'm doing, they'll also be scuffed

So yea, NTM for new mc versions. But its bad

Have fun :D

The mod will be updated whenever i see fit, so don't ask me when the next update is or what'll be added

Requirements
=======
- NeoForge (preferably the lastest version)
- Geckolib (also the lastest version)
